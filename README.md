# Image quality assessment using human visual DOG model fused with random forest
This code is a Matlab implementation of the feature extraction part in [1]. The function for extracting features from an image pair is "featurev1.m". To be more specific, the output X(6:10) is the luminance features for DOG-SSIM and X(18) is the chrominance feature.
You can train the DOG-SSIMc regression model with the feature set X([6:10, 18]), the Random Forest Regressor that I used can be found in [2] [LINK](https://code.google.com/archive/p/randomforest-matlab/downloads).
